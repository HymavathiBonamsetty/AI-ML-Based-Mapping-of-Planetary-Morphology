## Project Overview
Planetary morphology studies the surface features and geological structures of planets, which provides insights into planetary evolution and geological history. This project applies machine learning algorithms to analyze satellite and telescope imagery, aiming to automate the detection and mapping of planetary features.

## Objectives
- To automate planetary feature recognition and classification through AI and ML techniques.
- To create a scalable model capable of analyzing large planetary datasets.
- To visualize and map planetary morphology based on detected features for further analysis.

## Dataset
The dataset comprises various high-resolution planetary images, which include:
- Satellite imagery and telescope-captured images.
- Images categorized by feature to aid supervised training.

**Note**: The dataset may be subject to specific licensing agreements, and is not included in this repository.

## Methods and Algorithms
### Model Architecture
- **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)**: Used for feature extraction from planetary images.
- **YOLO (You Only Look Once)**: Employed for real-time object detection, specifically for the identification and localization of planetary features.
- **Classification and Segmentation Models**: Additional ML models for more detailed mapping of feature boundaries.

### Data Processing
- **Image Preprocessing**: Scaling, normalization, and augmentation techniques are applied to improve model performance.
- **Feature Engineering**: Manual and automated feature selection for improved detection accuracy.

### Training
The models were trained on GPU hardware for faster computation, with regularization and optimization techniques to enhance accuracy and reduce overfitting.
